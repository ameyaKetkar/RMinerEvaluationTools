/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#initiateMultipartUpload(InitiateMultipartUploadRequest) InitiateMultipartUpload operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier creates a
 * multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The
 * multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of
 * an archive (see UploadMultipartPart).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in
 * number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied
 * by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304
 * (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is
 * 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart),
 * except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the
 * same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2
 * MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4
 * MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> You don't need to know the size of the archive when you
 * start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you
 * to specify the overall archive size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the
 * multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also
 * removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart
 * upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24
 * hours.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
 * (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
 * don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
 * permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) </a>
 * .
