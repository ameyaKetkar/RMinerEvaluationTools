/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonGlacier.
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold data."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides
 * secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival.
 * With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively
 * for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers
 * to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage
 * to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware
 * provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or
 * time-consuming hardware migrations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is
 * paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of
 * several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or
 * frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more
 * information, go to
 * <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/"> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum
 * limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you
 * begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon Glacier
 * Developer Guide</i> :
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * 
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html"> What is Amazon Glacier </a>
 * - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data
 * model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use
 * to interact with the service.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * 
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html"> Getting Started with Amazon Glacier </a>
 * - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of
 * creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download
 * archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.

     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an Amazon Simple

     * job notifications are always sent. For more information, see
     * SetVaultNotifications.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>Get job details</b> You can make a DescribeJob request to obtain
     * job status information while a job is in progress. However, it is more
     * efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is
     * complete.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> The information you get via notification is same that

     * <p>
     * If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration
     * on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job

     * <b>About the Vault Inventory</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically,
     * every 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon
     * Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data
     * you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate
     * inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download
     * the vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory
     * for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find
     * the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive,
     * you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon
     * Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of
     * characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive
     * names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You
     * might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to
     * reconcile information in your database with the actual vault
     * inventory.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Range Inventory Retrieval</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can limit the number of inventory items retrieved by filtering on
     * the archive creation date or by setting a limit.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <i>Filtering by Archive Creation Date</i>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can retrieve inventory items for archives created between
     * <code>StartDate</code> and <code>EndDate</code> by specifying values
     * for these parameters in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. Archives
     * created on or after the <code>StartDate</code> and before the
     * <code>EndDate</code> will be returned. If you only provide the
     * <code>StartDate</code> without the <code>EndDate</code> , you will
     * retrieve the inventory for all archives created on or after the
     * <code>StartDate</code> . If you only provide the <code>EndDate</code>
     * without the <code>StartDate</code> , you will get back the inventory
     * for all archives created before the <code>EndDate</code> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <i>Limiting Inventory Items per Retrieval</i>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can limit the number of inventory items returned by setting the
     * <code>Limit</code> parameter in the <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The
     * inventory job output will contain inventory items up to the specified
     * <code>Limit</code> . If there are more inventory items available, the
     * result is paginated. After a job is complete you can use the
     * DescribeJob operation to get a marker that you use in a subsequent
     * <b>InitiateJob</b> request. The marker will indicate the starting
     * point to retrieve the next set of inventory items. You can page
     * through your entire inventory by repeatedly making <b>InitiateJob</b>
     * requests with the marker from the previous <b>DescribeJob</b> output,
     * until you get a marker from <b>DescribeJob</b> that returns null,
     * indicating that there are no more inventory items available.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use the <code>Limit</code> parameter together with the date
     * range parameters.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>About Ranged Archive Retrieval</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or a
     * range of the archive. In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you
     * specify a byte range to return or the whole archive. The range
     * specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, that is the range start value
     * must be divisible by 1 MB and range end value plus 1 must be divisible
     * by 1 MB or equal the end of the archive. If the ranged archive
     * retrieval is not megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400
     * response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you
     * download using Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash
     * aligned.

     * Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the

     * </p>
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>SHA256 tree hash does not match</b> To ensure that part data is
     * not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the
     * part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data,
     * Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values
     * don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a
     * SHA256 tree hash, see
     * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html"> Computing Checksums </a>
     * .
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>Part size does not match</b> The size of each part except the last
     * must match the size specified in the corresponding
     * InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the
     * same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part
     * size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that
     * part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed.
     * However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <b>Range does not align</b> The byte range value in the request
     * does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding
     * initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304
     * bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to
     * 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range
     * value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and
     * the upload will fail. </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple
     * times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the
     * previously uploaded data.
