/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonCognitoSync asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon Cognito Sync <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that
 * enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data.
 * High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android.
 * You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's
 * available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't
 * need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can
 * use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials.
 * User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of
 * key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is
 * accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to
 * use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using
 * credentials retrieved with
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html"> Amazon Cognito Identity service </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you
 * will probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn
 * more, see the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html"> Developer Guide for Android </a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html"> Developer Guide for iOS </a>
