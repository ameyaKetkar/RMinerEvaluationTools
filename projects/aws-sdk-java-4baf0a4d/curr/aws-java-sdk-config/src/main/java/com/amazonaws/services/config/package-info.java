 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonConfig.
 *
 * AWS Config <p>
 * AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all
 * the AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS
 * Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS
 * resource and also to get information about the relationship between
 * the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon
 * EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an Elastic network
 * Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources
 * currently supported by AWS Config, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources"> Supported AWS Resources </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management
 * Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API,
 * or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and
 * the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing
 * requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this
 * protocol, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process </a>
 * .

 * For detailed information about AWS Config features and their
 * associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with AWS
 * Management Console, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html"> What Is AWS Config? </a>
 * in the <i>AWS Config Developer Guide</i> .
