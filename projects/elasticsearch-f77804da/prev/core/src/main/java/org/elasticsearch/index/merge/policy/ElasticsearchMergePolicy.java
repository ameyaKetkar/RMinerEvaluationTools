/**
 * A {@link MergePolicy} that upgrades segments and can upgrade merges.
 * <p>
 * It can be useful to use the background merging process to upgrade segments,
 * for example when we perform internal changes that imply different index
 * options or when a user modifies his mapping in non-breaking ways: we could
 * imagine using this merge policy to be able to add doc values to fields after
 * the fact or on the opposite to remove them.
 * <p>
 * For now, this {@link MergePolicy} takes care of moving versions that used to
 * be stored as payloads to numeric doc values.
